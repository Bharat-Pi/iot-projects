Bharat Pi NavIC GPS Tracker Shield works on all Bharat Pi boards and you can mount it as a shield. Refer the image adjacent to this readme to view on how to mount the shield on top of Bharat Pi boards.

IMPORTANT: When used as shield the device uses hardware serial and you need to pay attention while using this code with 4G module. There is a seperate code for Bharat Pi 4G board + NavIC shield for pushiing data to cloud in real time. You might want to use that directly than porting this code on to 4G.
